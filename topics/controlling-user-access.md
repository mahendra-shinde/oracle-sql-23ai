# Controlling User Access in Oracle Databases

Controlling user access is essential for database security and integrity. Oracle provides a robust system for managing users, privileges, and roles.

---

## 1. Users

A **user** is an account through which you can log in to the Oracle database. Each user owns a schema.

### Creating a User
```sql
CREATE USER hr IDENTIFIED BY strong_password;
```

### Altering a User
```sql
ALTER USER hr ACCOUNT LOCK;
ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY new_password;
```

### Dropping a User
```sql
DROP USER hr CASCADE;
```

---

## 2. Privileges

Privileges control the actions users can perform.

- **System Privileges:** Allow users to perform particular actions (e.g., CREATE TABLE).
- **Object Privileges:** Allow users to perform actions on specific objects (e.g., SELECT on a table).

### Granting System Privileges
```sql
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE TO hr;
```

### Granting Object Privileges
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO hr;
```

### Revoking Privileges
```sql
REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM hr;
```

---

## 3. Roles

A **role** is a named group of related privileges that can be granted to users or other roles.

### Creating a Role
```sql
CREATE ROLE manager_role;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE VIEW TO manager_role;
GRANT manager_role TO hr;
```

### Granting and Revoking Roles
```sql
GRANT manager_role TO scott;
REVOKE manager_role FROM scott;
```

---

## 4. Best Practices
- Use strong passwords and enforce password policies.
- Grant the least privilege necessary for users to perform their tasks.
- Use roles to simplify privilege management.
- Regularly review and audit user privileges.
