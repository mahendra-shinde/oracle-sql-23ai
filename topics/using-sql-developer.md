## Using Oracle SQL Developer

Oracle SQL Developer is a free, integrated development environment provided by Oracle for working with Oracle databases. It offers a graphical interface for database development, management, and administration, making it easier for users to interact with Oracle Database 23ai and earlier versions.

### Key Features
- **Intuitive GUI**: Drag-and-drop interface for building queries and managing objects.
- **SQL Worksheet**: Write, execute, and test SQL and PL/SQL code.
- **Data Modeling**: Design, document, and generate database schemas visually.

### Getting Started
1. **Download and Install**: Obtain SQL Developer from Oracle's official website and install it on your system (no database installation required).
2. **Connect to a Database**: Launch SQL Developer, create a new connection using your Oracle database credentials (host, port, service/SID, username, password).
3. **Explore the Interface**: Use the navigation panel to browse tables, views, procedures, and other objects.
4. **Run SQL/PLSQL**: Open a SQL Worksheet to write and execute queries or scripts.
5. **Use Data Modeler**: Access the built-in data modeling tool for ER diagrams and schema design.

1. Click the green **+** icon in the Connections panel.
2. Enter connection details (name, username, password, hostname, port, service/SID).
3. Test the connection and click **Connect**.

### Tips
- Use code snippets and templates to speed up development.
- Take advantage of the Query Builder for visual query design.
